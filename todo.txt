TODO:
- Get rid of Swagger, it's no longer a backend only
- Condense models
- Use DB unless entities aren't in DB
- Reduce external API calls
- Maybe make a single DB table for albums that stores all the data
- Display available artists/albums instead of search
- Provide a way to request an artist/album (https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/intro-to-flask-adding-a-contact-page--net-28982)
- include songs that don't have lyrics?
- profanity checker
- repeated phrases by artist/album
- graphs/charts to display data
- compare artists?
- words per minute
